# GOMP (**G**it c**OMP**are) Legacy Version

GOMP was originally written in Python 2 by Ariel Wexler. If, for whatever reason, you need or prefer to use Python 2, this folder contains the original Python 2 implementation of GOMP. This version of GOMP is not officially supported and is only included for legacy systems/backwards compatibility as needed.

To install, clone the respository and then add the following to your bash profile or equivalent:

```bash
$ alias gomp="python /path/to/gomp/gomp.py"
```
